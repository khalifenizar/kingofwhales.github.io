	<h1> Demographics and Alcohol Consumption</h1>
		<p>To better understand the graph, it's important to realize that
			this graph is simply a reflection of multiple intertwined factors. For example, marraige might in general 
			be correlated with less alcohol consumption. However, this correlation tends to become less strong as people get older.

			<br>
			<br>
			Some anomalies are also discovered through this visualization. Some of these are due to the small sample size of a specific group. Others might suggest some interesting interaction between multiple factors. 
			Viewers are encouraged to explore these correlations through the recommended readings in the summary below. 
		</p>
	<h2> Education</h2>
		<p> Interestingly enough, higher education is overall correlated with more alcohol consumption. 
			This result is also supported by previous findings(1): college adults drink twice as much as people who didn't finish high school. 
			<br>
			
			<br>
			I can't really find an good explanation for the unusually high drinking rate for 18-24 years old male adults who belongs to the "less than high school" group. In this case, we can see a huge difference between the male(1.23) and female(0.1) drinking rate.
			Part of the reason could be that education is also correlated with marital status(2). In general, lower education is correlated with early marraige. 
			Around the age of 20, females adults are twice as likely to get married when compared with males adults who have "high school or less" education.
			However, this still can't explain the huge difference in our case.
			<br>
		</p>
	<h2> Race</h2>
		<p> Overall, White people drink the most and Asians drink the least. 
			It's important to notice here the difference between alcohol use and binge drinking. When it comes to binge drinking, other studies have found something different:
			Hispanics tend to binge drink the most, followed by Caucasian and multiracial people(1). 
			<br>
			<br>
			The age group 2 spike for the "other" category might be due to the small sample size. However, other studies have also shown that 47 percent of multi-racial/other people drink, compared to the 56 percent White people(1). 
		
		</p>
	<h2> Marital Status</h2>
		<p> Marriage equals less drinking! 
		<br>
		<br>
		This might seem intuitive to a lot of people. In general, members of unmarried couples drink the most.
		<br>
		<br>
		One other interesting thing I have found is that people who divorce at a early age tend to also drink a lot more. Previous studies have found that alcoholism at a early stage
		is correlated with high divorce rate(3). Also, I couldn't explain the fact that females who lost their partner at the age of 18 to 24 drink an unusually high amount of alcohol.
